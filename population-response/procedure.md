**Steps to run the simulator**

1.	User can select the stimulus for neural population activity by using the different parameters provided in the GUI.

2.	The neural population response for specific stimulus were generated in GUI platform.

3.	The mathematical model reconstructing the average response of neural population.

4.	Local field potential by an extracellular potential were emulated by computational algorithms

5.	User can able to visualize the firing patterns of a neural population in a single window.
