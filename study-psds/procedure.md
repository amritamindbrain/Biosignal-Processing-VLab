•	The GUI Platform allows the user to upload EEG data file (EDF FORMAT) with markers to differentiate specific cognitive tasks performed at a particular time.

•	The simulator platform provide icons that allows the user to decompose EEG data into millisecond time scale.

•	User can able to visualize event related epochs at the given time intervals.

•	 User can visualize power spectrum distribution of brain rhythms on a millisecond time scale.

•	User can identify the variation of spectral density in different lobes of brain at different time bins and can infer the neural oscillatory variations with respect to cognitive tasks.
