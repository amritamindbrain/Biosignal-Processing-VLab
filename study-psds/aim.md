•	To understand varying power spectrum distribution of brain rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) in different brain lobes in a shorter time segment window.

•	To understand event-related EEG epochs in specific cognitive tasks and to characterize magnitude and phase information of EEG signals on a millisecond time scale.

•	To compute and visualize event-related changes in sensory, cognitive or motor actions depending on time-frequency representations of spectral density.
