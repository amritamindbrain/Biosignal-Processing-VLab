# Biosignal Processing and Analysis Lab
This lab provides a platform for EEG data analysis and visualization for understanding the correlations of neural activity through electroencephalography data. Experiments designed in this lab help student communities to acquire expertise on fundamental tools that were necessary to describe, analyze and process common biological signals. With the recent trends of interest from computational neuroscience research, the experimental strategies were featured with models of neurons to understand general properties of neural networks and to graphically visualize how biological neurons work with computational efficiency. The lab focuses on an open-source signal analysis platform that can also be extended by students from across the internet.


# About

The simulation is a web-based application that allows to click and execute directly from a browser (web-based simulation platform).
The application is very light, does not require any installation other than a modern browser.

# Installation
  - Clone the latest version of the Web Application.
  - Unpack archive and open file `<experiment_name>/index.html` in your browser.
