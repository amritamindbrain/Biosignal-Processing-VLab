1.	User can upload the recorded EEG data as a ﬁle in European Data Format (EDF).

2.	User can run “PSD” tab on GUI to visualize topographic maps of epoch PSD and evoked potentials.

3.	The platform allows the user to identify the PSD of individual events such as grasping, squeezing, movement or user could visualize the entire raw EEG data over the period of time.

4.	The platform provides tabs for slicing EEG data to different time frames, filtering for to set frequency range according to user’s choice, and virtual markers to differentiate each event in raw EEG data.

5.	Users can visualize power spectrum graph of the EEG data depending on the parameters provided.

6.	User have to correlate PSD values to different activities in the bio signal at different time bins applying theoretical background to an experimental output.
