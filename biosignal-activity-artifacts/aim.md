•	To understand basic concepts of bio signal analysis and to explore characteristics of biosignals in time and frequency domain.

•	To understand different forms of artifacts; internal artifacts (eye blinks, muscle movements) and external artifacts (environmental noises) in biological signals and learn steps in signal processing techniques for noise removal in EEG signals	

•	 To detect the specific events such as motor execution, motor planning etc. in biosignals using signal processing techniques.
