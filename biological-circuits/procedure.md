1.	User can able to select the neuron model using different parameters provided in the GUI.

2.	After selecting the model, Connect the neuron models with designated synaptic function.

3.	Reconstruct the neural networks with constitutive elements and explore the role of single neurons in the network.

4.	Generate Biological neural firing patterns using Adex algorithms.
a)	The modelling of biological circuits helps the user how the different parameter influences signal propagation and information processing in a specific time period.

5.	The modelling helps to understand the abstract representations of neuronal properties and connectivity patterns and map complex inputâ€“output signaling using minimal networks of neuronal units.
